# Binary-to-decimal-Decimal-to-Binary-Converter
PURPOSE:
The purpose of this compiler is to help conversion of binary to decimal and decimal to binary easily. They can also convert values around with their output by just writing some English peace of text code (like zero, one) which is human language mostly and has a simple syntax unlike programming languages to follow. Without taking much care about the syntax.

SCOPE:
Since, for non-technical, even normal conversions is a big deal. But with the development and progress of time technology and computers are becoming a basic need for everyone. People know what they want but they have no clue how it would be done. As the main idea is to develop the basic computer skills instead of focusing much on the language specifications and syntax, it will help a large range of users to develop their coding and logical skills. It is easy to modify and with time by making updates according to the user use, it will attract more users. 

OBJECTIVES:
 The objective of the compiler is very clear and as discussed earlier, it is an approach to help with conversions  instead of focusing a lot on the syntax. A user friendly software, that is easy to use and making updates and adding up new things to it with time according to the requirements would be easier. The main idea is to develop technical skills instead of focusing much on the language specifications and syntax, it will help a large range of users to develop their skills.
